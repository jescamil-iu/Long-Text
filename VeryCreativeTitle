Ok! I'm sorry for the late reply, but I been searching the internet for deals on parts, as well as whole prebuilt systems this whole week. 
Building a new system, right now, is probably not the best move in my opinion. My recommendation is to buy a existing system already built. 
I found 3 reasonably priced pc's on offerup local.
 
PC #1: The link for this pc is https://offerup.com/item/detail/1347160791?q=pc. It is priced at $300. It comes with a keyboard and mouse, has dedicated graphics, 
and is a good deal. The pc is a bit on the older side, but it is still a good option for a budget pc. It can run games like Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft. 
Maybe some other esports titles that are not too graphically demanding. My concern is whether this is legit or not because it sound too good to be true and the 
seller account was made this month. Also on the main photo in the listing, there is some damage to the motherboard (bottom right corner)
 
PC #2: The link for this pc is https://offerup.com/item/detail/1353330490?q=pc. It is priced at $380. It comes without a mouse and keyboard. This pc is a big step
up from the first pc because it has better components. But again, it sound too good of a deal, given that mostly all listing are up in price because of the 
economy and the shortage of components.
 
PC #3: The link for this pc is https://offerup.com/item/detail/1353223716?q=pc. It is priced at $650. It comes without KBM. If you have the budget, 
I would snipe this listing because it is a reasonably priced pc given its specs. The only weak side of this pc is the graphics card, 
but that is very understandable because of the listing price. Most of these components in this pc are actually better than some of mine. 
 
I am going to try and find some more, but a lot of the listings have absurd low/high prices (obvs a scam), or did not list pc specs. 
I tried asking for the pc specs but I yet to get a response from a single person. But the three options I listed are the only ones I see that may have potential. 
In my opinion I'd probably choose the second pc, because its a bang to the buck build with reasonable specs.
